The following project analyzes fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) data that depicts the intensity of activation through and the regions associated with a depression disorder through a statistical map and Histogram that represents the frequency of (positive) Voxel intensity values to understand the value distribution. The data stems from an online database ([link](https://neurosynth.org/)) and includes anatomical and functional data. This task was to showcase my knowledge and skills of handling files and implementing the corresponding code, visualizing fMRI data (here on a dataset representing activity in depression) and analyzing the data in form of a Histogram with an ellaborate, discriptive and precise code.

## Table of content:

1. Output Visualizations: image files of visualizations, including (1) brain map, and (2) histogram.

2. Jupiter Notebook: contains the code with markdowns for explanation

3. PullRequest_evidence: showcasing Pullrequest handling

4. ReadMe: ReadMe file

5. Data Files: data downloaded and accessed (02.12.2024) through Neurosynth,([link](https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/depression/))

## Python packages: 

1. OS: directory operation & file handling
   
2. Glob: function that search for files with matching pattern

3. Nibabel: package to read and access neuroimaging data files

4. Nilearn: package to visualize fMRI data

5. matplotlib: package for plotting Histograms
